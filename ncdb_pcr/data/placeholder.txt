Due to a data use agreement with the NCDB, the underlying data must be downloaded from the NCDB itself (https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/cancer-programs/national-cancer-database/puf/) after completing an application. For this project, data was downloaded in the SAS format and SAS was used to convert the rectal cancer PUF to csv ('rectum.csv' used here) for use in Python/Pandas.
